Grammar Annotations

-Constructions lacking:
- repeat until
- for Name = exp, exp[, exp] do
- parens around functioncall are optional if parameter is String or tableconstructor

Checks that need to be made:
- statements after return are sytnax error
- funcname can only have names
- functioncall must start with prefixexp

New constructions required:
- var: name, bracket access, dot access
- prefixexp: things that can be bracket or dot accessed (var, functioncall, exp inside parens)
- parlist: list of names, possibly ending with '...'
- field ::= `[´ exp `]´ `=´ exp | Name `=´ exp | exp Cursor based editing
