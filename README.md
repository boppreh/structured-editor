structured-editor
=================

This is a code editor with a different paradigm: instead of editing the source code *text*,
it edits the source code *structure*. Currently the only language supported is [Lua](http://www.lua.org/), but new
extensions are being planned.

This program is being developed as the final project for an undergraduate degree in Computer Science.
